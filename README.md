## Tools to be implemented

-Investment Tab: Seeing as this project is intended to be a finance tracker, it would be beneficial to also allow for investment information to be added as well.

## Reflection

This project is a side project with the intent of building out an idea. This was also a great oppertunity to work on my problem solving skills (learning nextjs framework) while also continue to stregthen my frontend skills as well.

The idea of this project came from a financal tracker I built in excel. The entire project's inital focus was on recreating the exact spreedsheet but through code. However, now that I have hit that inital goal, there is still room to continue to build on this project and I plan to do just that. 

Through the various obstacles thus far, I believe the most difficult challenge has been learning how to learn throughout the development process. What I mean by this is that this is my first experience having to learn (and fix) these different frameworks and systems without having something like peer-coding being available.
